    <h2>Home - CMS definition</h2>
    <p>I've run multiple blogs in my life, but you know what I've never had to do? Manually add a byline field, publish date element, or related articles section to a post. Those are all taken care of by a content management system (CMS). 
    This isn't how the web always worked. Once upon a time, every page on a website was hand-crafted, and I would have had to add all of those elements to every blog post if I wanted them to appear. Using a CMS means I don't have to do that, and that it's easy to update how these elements look for thousands of articles all at once. </p>
